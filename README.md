## Dates Project Exercise

### Collaboration
1. One team member opens a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub) and shares the repository link with the team members. Ensure that everyone has access to the repository and can contribute to it.
2. Each team member clones the remote repository to their local development environment using Git.
3. Before pushing any changes, team members should always pull the latest changes from the remote repository to ensure they have the most up-to-date code. Encourage regular communication and updates among team members to avoid conflicts.
4. If conflicts arise while pulling or pushing code, the team should work together to resolve them. Provide guidelines or documentation on conflict resolution strategies using Git.

Project Tasks
The team should collectively work on the following tasks:
(Hernan) Show a simple menu using the input() function to allow users to select different options. Design an intuitive menu that guides users through the available features.

(Alex) Display the current time using the appropriate module or function. Use Python's built-in datetime module to retrieve the current time and format it for display.

(Marouan) Display the current time in UNIX format using the appropriate module or function. Convert the current time to UNIX timestamp format using the time module or other relevant libraries.

(Gloria) Convert a string to a datetime datatype and provide proof of the conversion. Implement a function that accepts a user-provided string and converts it to a datetime object. Validate the conversion by displaying the converted value.

(Hernan) Check if the current year is a leap year and display the amount of time left until the next leap year. Use the calendar module or custom logic to determine if the current year is a leap year. Calculate the time remaining until the next leap year and present it in a human-readable format.

(Ievgeniia) Output a timedelta object with options to display only seconds, only days, or only years. Create a function that accepts a timedelta object and provides options to extract specific units (seconds, days, or years) from it. Allow users to choose which unit they want to display.

(Ievgeniia)Print a calendar for the current month or a specified month. Use the calendar module or external libraries to generate a calendar for the current month or a month specified by the user. Ensure the calendar is displayed in a clear and readable format.

(Hernan)Your team is a multinational one meeting a regional leader based in Tokyo, Japan with the following regions:

Dublin / Ireland
San Francisco / USA
Berlin / Germany
Johannesburg / South Africa
you are asked to Implement a feature to display the current time in different time zones. Allow users to select a timezone from a list and display the current time in that timezone. Utilize libraries to handle timezone conversions.
(Marouan) Determine and display the current time at the opposite end of the world. Implement a function that calculates the time difference between the user's current location and the opposite end of the world. Display both times to provide a comparison.

(Alex) Output a random joke from a predefined collection. Create a collection of jokes and implement a function that randomly selects and displays one of the jokes each time it is called.

(Gloria) Implement an additional surprise feature of your choice. Encourage creativity and allow the team to come up with a unique feature to add to the program. It can be related to dates, time, or any other relevant topic.

### Timeframe
This project should be completed within two days. Plan your tasks and allocate sufficient time for development, testing, and integration. Regularly communicate with your team members to ensure progress and address any issues that arise.

Remember to encourage collaboration, code reviews, and documentation throughout the project. Document any important decisions, assumptions, or challenges faced during the development process.

Good luck with your project! If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
